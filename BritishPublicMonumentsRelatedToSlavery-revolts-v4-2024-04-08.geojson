Along with his friend, another black man named William Green, he approached the famous abolitionist lawyer Granville Sharp and asked for his help. Samuel Jeffries, owner of the huge Windsor Estate in Westmoreland, Jamaica, had ‘trepanned his Negro servant Harry [Demaine] and sent him on ship board,’ intending to take him back to slavery in the Americas against his will. Sharp acted swiftly. Three days later, Jeffries received a visit from his former servant Demaine, not only free but accompanied by law officers and demanding restitution.&quot; Hanley, R. (2018).

Among the charges are that some of them took the Ship Neptune whose cargo included \"ten negroes\" though it is not described whether they were freed.
